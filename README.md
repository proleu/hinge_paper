### Common modules, methods, files and scripts for Praetorius and Leung et al. 2023

Included environments are tested on Ubuntu 20.04
The majority of notebooks and many util scripts are intended to be run on
computational resources that Institute for Protein Design labs have access to such as the digs, and NERSC perlmutter
It is likely possible to modify the scripts to work on any cluster with a SLURM 
scheduler, and intended to be straightforward to do so.
